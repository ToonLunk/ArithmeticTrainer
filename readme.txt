This game was finished by Chase Brock on May 4th, 2021. 

This program will generate two random numbers and either mutliply, divide, subtract, or add them together. It will
prompt the user with the two numbers, and the user must enter the correct answer. If a correct answer
is entered, points are added to the score, and the game continues. If not, the game ends, and a function will
check to see if the current score is the highest recorded and if so, replace the current number in highscores.txt
with the new, highest score. The player can choose to play the game, view the current high score, or quit the game
from the main menu.
